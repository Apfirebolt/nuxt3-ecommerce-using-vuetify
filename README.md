This is an Ecommerce web-app I was experimenting with while learning Nuxt 3. It uses one of the APIs I created earlier in Django using dataset from this popular Ecommerce store in India called "Myntra.com".

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

Here's the link of the back-end API used for this project 
- https://github.com/Apfirebolt/Myntra_ecommerce_api_in_django
- Created in Python using Django framework with Postgres as database.

## Features

At the time of writing this it contains following prominent features :-

- Items page with pagination, shows info such as price, discount, link to the actual product.

- Back-end sorting and filtering applied using Django filter-backends.

- Uses Vuetify for UI components.
